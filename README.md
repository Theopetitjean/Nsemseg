# Non semantique unsupervised segmentation : 


This code is an adaptation of a methods called Fine grained segmentation, 
published in Fine-Grained Segmentation Networks: Self-Supervised Segmentation 
for Improved Long-Term Visual Localization (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06387)   


## Dataset and ressources  

The data set is private and teh main ressources (code are comming from an adaptation
of the code from face book (Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning
of Visual Features) and the fine grained implementation.  

## Licences 


ALL the code used are adapted to a polarimetric method but the still remain to
the creator, so please be sure to check the licences therms for the original code
