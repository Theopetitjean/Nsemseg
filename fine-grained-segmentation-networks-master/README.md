# Fine-Grained Segmentation Networks: Self-Supervised Segmentation for Improved Long-Term Visual Localization
This is an implementation of the work published in Fine-Grained Segmentation Networks: Self-Supervised Segmentation for Improved Long-Term Visual Localization (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06387)

## Resources 
The datasets used in the paper is published at visuallocalization.net

## Trained Models
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ks_HDb3ipNlJsNiTbLNSvqSIZ8Is8xCk

## Installation
A Dockerfile is provided, either build a docker image using this or refer to the requirements listed in the file.
In addition, a requirements.txt is provided.

## Usage 
- Download Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas
- Use /utils/convert_vistas_to_cityscapes.py to create cityscapes class annotations for the Vistas images
- Download the correspondence datasets
- Download the images associated with the correspondence datasets (instructions available in dataset readme)
- Create a global_otps.json and set the paths (see global_opts_example.json)
- Get base models from the trained models link above, place the 'base-networks' folder in global_opts['result-folder']
- Run /clustering/setup_cluster_dataset for the dataset to be trained on
- Train, see train/train_many_cluster.py for reproduction of paper main experiments
